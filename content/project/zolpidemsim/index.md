## Zolpidem PK simulator

Zolpidem, a nonbenzodiazepine known for its sedative and hypnotic effects, has been approved for short-term insomnia treatment but a growing number of individuals misuse it for recreational purposes or to achieve a euphoric or calming sensation.

Zolpidem overdose can lead to life-threatening complications, including respiratory depression and coma and emergency physicians face considerable challenges in effectively monitoring drug concentrations while managing overdose cases. However, our comprehension of the toxicokinetics of zolpidem overdose remains limited. In this study, we have developed "Zolpidemsim", a web-based application https://pipettox.shinyapps.io/Zolpidem to predict plasma zolpidem concentration and pharmacokinetic parameters in overdosed patients.

The prompt and real-time simulation of toxic concentration profiles provided by Zolpidemsim may help to determine appropriate decision-making or intervention and to avoid unnecessary treatments for stable patients. 
The Zolpidemsim supports cross-platform compatibility, and its user interface is adapted to the size and capabilities of any device (desktop, tablet, or smartphone) and this feature is crucial for healthcare professionals or researchers.
For students and trainees, this web-based tool can serve as educational platforms, illustrating the pharmacokinetics of zolpidem in overdose scenarios.
The user-friendly predictive tool will be a valuable asset for healthcare professionals, empowering them to make well-informed decisions and gain critical prognostic insights, ultimately enhancing the management of zolpidem overdose patients.
